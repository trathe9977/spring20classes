    <p>The American Battlefield Trust is an organization dedicated to preserving the land on which battles were fought in the US.  They match private donations with goverment grants to purchase available land, and restore the ground to its appearance at the time of the battle if possible. Then the land is donated to the National Park Service or other local government agencies to ensure it remains a historical landmark, free of real estate development.</p>
