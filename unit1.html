    <h1>My Favorite Movie Trilogy</h1>
      <p>By far, my favorite movie trilogy is the original Star Wars saga.  I remember seeing Star Wars for the first time at a drive-in theater.  Darth Vader was 40 feet tall, and I was hooked.  Two sequels followed to complete the original trilogy:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><i>Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope</i></li>
          <li><i>Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back</i></li>
          <li><i>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi</i></li>
        </ol>
      <p>Over the years I have been in many discussions with friends and family regarding which is better, Star Wars or Star Trek.  I am <b>not</b> saying that I don't like Star Trek, or other big ticket trilogies such as The Lord of the Rings. I have always preferred the films of the Star Wars universe for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Varied and exotic alien species</li>
          <li>Innovative ship designs</li>
          <li>Strange new planets</li>
          <li>A grittier, lived-in feeling to the universe</li>
        </ul>
